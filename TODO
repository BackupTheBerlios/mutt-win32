Problems are listed in approximate order of priority.

- re-add support for .mh_sequences files

- Fix the "unexpected EXPUNGE" IMAP bug.

- Ask IMAP servers for hierarchy separators. (-> Brandon's
  note from Aug 18)

  
- In the "attachment" menu, assume this:

	1 [text/plain, 7bit, 1.1K]           <no description>
	2 [message/rfc822, 7bit, 6.1K]       A test message
	3 [text/plain, 7bit, 0.1K]           |-><no description>
	4 [message/rfc822, base64, 2.5K]     |-><no description>
	5 [message/rfc822, base64, 2.7K]     `-><no description>

  (please note the "message/rfc822" attachments encoded as
  Base64; that's illegal, but Sun's Mailtool sends that
  kind of messages); then go to, say, attachment "4",
  delete it, and go to the main menu; you won't be able to
  quit the mailbox (ok, 'x' works, but 'q' doesn't).

  The problem here lies in the fact that mutt uses mailbox
  handling functions to access message/rfc822 type
  attachments.  We'd need to perform an additional
  decoding step before using these functions to fix this
  bug.

  Please note that mutt's just assuming RFC-compliant mail
  here.  Fixing this stuff may become a PITA.




- BODY struct should probably have a pointer to its
  corresponding HEADER struct.  this is needed for
  mh/maildir mailboxes so the correct pathname can be
  found.  Or perhaps all we need is a .hdr member of the
  STATE struct so that all of the MIME handlers can look
  up the corresponding HEADERs if need be?

- option to not include attachments in replies

- handle message/external-body in some fashion

- handle message/partial reconstruction
