How to add use mutt's S/MIME capabilities

- Download and install OpenSSL.

- Get yourself a certificate. (You can get one for free from www.thawte.com,
or pay for one from VeriSign or one of its competitors) The way the process
generally works, the certificate will be installed "into" your web browser.
If you are asked what application you wish to use the certificate with,
select Netscape. Strangely enough, "mutt" is usually not an option.

- Assuming you are using Mozilla, follow the instructions at
www.verisignlabs.com/Projects/smime_docs/linux.html to export the
certificate into a file called cert.p12. If you don't use Mozilla, you're on
your own.

- Run "smime_keys.pl add_p12 cert.p12"

    * When the script asks for the "Import password", enter the one you
      provided when you exported the certificate.

    * When it asks for a "PEM pass phrase", make up a new password. Every
      time you sign or decrypt a message, mutt will ask for the PEM pass
      phrase.

    * Finally, when the script asks for a label, enter an easy-to-remember
      name for the certificate, such as "me". The script output will include
      a line like:

      added private key: /home/raldi/.smime/keys/12345678.0 for raldi@verisignlabs.com

      The number (including the ".0" at the end) is your keyid. You will
      need this number in the next step.

- Add the contents of contrib/smime.rc to your .muttrc. Edit the
smime_sign_as line, replacing the keyid with your own.

- You probably want to import the trusted roots in
contrib/ca-bundle.crt. Use "smime_keys.pl add_root" to do so. That makes you
trust anything that was ultimately signed by one of them.
