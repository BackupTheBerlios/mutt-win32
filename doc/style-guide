Mutt Programming Style Guide
============================

This information is meant for those of you who are hacking
on Mutt and submitting patches to me.  If you follow these
guidelines, it will make it much easier for me to
integrate patches.

- global functions should have the prefix "mutt_".  All
  other functions should be declared "static".

- avoid global vars where possible.  If one is required,
  try to contain it to a single source file and declare it
  "static".  Global vars should have the first letter of
  each word capitilized, and no underscores should be used
  (e.g., MailGid, LastFolder, MailDir).

- re-use code as much as possible.  There are a lot of
  "library" functions. One of the biggest causes of bloat
  in ELM and PINE is the tremendous duplication of code...
  Help keep Mutt small!

- when adding new options, make the old behaviour the
  default.  Please include the new option and it's default
  setting with the global Muttrc file.
