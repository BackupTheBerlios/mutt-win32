Major changes since 0.93
------------------------

- i18n support of various kinds: Mutt now comes with character set
  definitions, so it is able to convert character sets you encounter
  in e-mail messagese to your local display's character set as
  defined by the $charset configuration variable.  This includes a
  poorly-tested UTF-8 decoder.

  Additionally, mutt includes GNU gettext support, so you can make
  it speak your own language.  To use this, just set the environment
  variable "LANG" appropriately.

  (For a list of currently supported languages, have a look at the
  po files in the po subdirectory.)

- There is support for the POP3 "last" command for just fetching the
  latest unread messages from your POP server.  To enable use of
  this feature, set the $pop_last configuration option.

- The IMAP code's handling of server-side EXPUNGE messages was
  fixed, so mutt should now be able to cope with concurrent access
  to IMAP folders.  This is, e.g., supported by the CMU and MS
  Exchange IMAP servers.

- mh_sequences support was _dropped_.  The reason is, on the one
  hand, a major re-write of the mh and maildir folder
  resynchronization code, and the fact that there is no locking
  protocol defined for this file.  If you want to use
  one-file-per-message folders, you should better rely on maildir.

- The new patterns ~g and ~G in the pattern language match PGP
  signed and encrypted messages, respectively.

- The $smileys configuration variable defines exceptions from the
  quote-detecting regular expressions.  This can be used to
  correctly handle lines beginning with smileys such as ":-)" -
  these lines were detected as quoted text by the old code.

- The syntax for function keys in key bindings and macro definitions
  has changed:  Instead of "fN", you have to use "<fN>" now.  This
  is more consistant with the syntax for the other special keys like
  "<up>", "<down>", and so on.

- We have a new feature named edit-message.  This enables you to
  edit a message from one of your mail folders and re-send or
  re-file it afterwards.

- Thread collapsing is there: To control it, we have the two
  functions collapse-all and collapse-thread, and the configuration
  variables $collapse_unread and $collapse_jump.

- We have a new set of functions decrypt-{save,copy}. They strip off
  the initial layer of PGP/MIME encryption.  For "classical"
  application/pgp messages, they are equivalent to the decode
  functions, for unencrypted messages they fall back to the normal
  save functions.

- The build-time "hidden host" option has gone.  Use the
  $hidden_host configuration variable instead.

- Unknown major MIME types are recognized properly.

- An option $write_bcc controls whether or not the Bcc header is
  written out to the mail transport agent or not.  Exim users may
  wish to use this.

- The compose menu tries to detect and smoothly handle changes to
  attached files.

- On the compose menu, you can generate a "private" copy of an
  attached file using the get-attachment function.

- sendmail's exit values are properly interpreted, so you will no
  longer get a "no such file or directory" error when sending mail
  to a non-existing local user.

- The variable $attach_format controls the look of the compose and
  attach menus.

- The file browser permits you to view files before selecting them.

- Bug fixes of all kinds.  Look at the ChangeLog file for details.

- The configuration files now go to a directory determined by the
  --sysconfdir parameter to the configure script.  The default is
  ${prefix}/etc.  (The install target of the top-level Makefile will
  take care of your old site-global configuration file and
  automagically move it to the new place.)
