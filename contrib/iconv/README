This directory contains sample collections of iconv-hooks for
various platforms.  The files have been auto-generated from the
source code of Bruno Haible's libiconv implementation, version 1.5.1.

libiconv is available from <http://clisp.cons.org/~haible/packages-libiconv.html>.

If you want to re-generate the files from a newer version of
libiconv, just type:

	rm -f *.rc
	./make.sh <top-level iconv directory>

Note, however, that make.sh isn't guaranteed to run on any system
but the one used for generating these files.
