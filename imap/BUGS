In no particular order:

* Mutt doesn't handle timeouts or dropped connections gracefully.

* Have a hard time when the home namespace isn't default "".

* Mutt browses Cyrus IMAP servers poorly, because of Cyrus' feature where
  folders can contain messages *and* subfolders, and because of the 
  namespace problem, which Cyrus uses.

* The mutt_pretty routines don't work well when the delimiter isn't '/'.
