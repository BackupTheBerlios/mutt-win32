In no particular order:

* Mutt is uninterruptible during socket calls. We should handle SIGINT.

* Not really an IMAP bug, but postponed-message checking is done too often,
  incurring needless network overhead.

* Server copy currently doesn't take into account uncommitted changes in
  messages about to be copied. Sync first.

* Mutt doesn't handle timeouts or dropped connections gracefully.

* Have a hard time when the home namespace isn't default "".

* Mutt browses Cyrus IMAP servers poorly, because of Cyrus' feature where
  folders can contain messages *and* subfolders, and because of the 
  namespace problem, which Cyrus uses.

* The mutt_pretty routines don't work well when the delimiter isn't '/'.
