In no particular order:

* Mutt doesn't handle timeouts or dropped connections gracefully. You
  may see occasional segfaults. Solving this cleanly requires some major
  architectural updates. Until that happens, I recommend you keep
  backup copies of messages you're composing from within your editor.

* Sometimes hdr->env seems to be NULL, according to other users' core
  files. I haven't been able to reproduce this, and am not sure how
  to track it down. But it's very naughty indeed.

* Rex Walters reports that STORE on folders with lr is attempting to
  store null flags instead of skipping the STORE. Strange, there are
  checks against exactly this in imap_sync_mailbox.

* Mutt seems to sometimes handle new messages which arrive in the middle
  of downloading old messages incorrectly. It counts too many.

* Mutt marks your connection for logout as soon as you say quit, even if
  you bail out with ^G later.

* Mutt is uninterruptible during socket calls. We should handle SIGINT.

* Not really an IMAP bug, but postponed-message checking is done too often,
  incurring needless network overhead.

* Server copy currently doesn't take into account uncommitted changes in
  messages about to be copied. Sync first.

* Have a hard time when the home namespace isn't default "".

* Mutt browses Cyrus IMAP servers poorly, because of Cyrus' feature where
  folders can contain messages *and* subfolders, and because of the 
  namespace problem, which Cyrus uses.

* The mutt_pretty routines don't work well when the delimiter isn't '/'.
