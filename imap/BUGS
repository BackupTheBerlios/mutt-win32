19991028: The code to refetch message flags while fetching messages so they
  don't have to be stored on close seems to have been broken. I am suspicious
  of the changes to use mutt_flag_set globally instead of tuning them
  manually...

* Mutt doesn't handle timeouts or dropped connections gracefully. You
  may see occasional segfaults. Solving this cleanly requires some major
  architectural updates. Until that happens, I recommend you keep
  backup copies of messages you're composing from within your editor.

* Sometimes hdr->env seems to be NULL, according to other users' core
  files. I haven't been able to reproduce this, and am not sure how
  to track it down. But it's very naughty indeed.

* Mutt sometimes doesn't notice new mail has arrived until you've opened
  another folder, leading to the wrong number of messages being downloaded.
  To make matters worse, imap_read_headers doesn't detect the * BAD response.
  --> note: although the command structure may change, currently this can
      be handled by adding imap_cmd_finish after any command which may
      operate in the SELECTED state.
      Also any code that does SELECT (eg imap_open_mailbox) should be
      taking care to reset IMAP_DATA state on success. Apparently it's not.

* Mutt marks your connection for logout as soon as you say quit, even if
  you bail out with ^G later.
  --> This should be fixed by not using imap_set_logout. Instead there
      should be a function which loops through all connections and logs
      out of them one at a time. Multiple connections haven't gotten much
      testing.

* Mutt is uninterruptible during socket calls. We should handle SIGINT.

* Server copy currently doesn't take into account uncommitted changes in
  messages about to be copied. Sync first.
  --> walk tagged or individual message looking for changes, sync those?
      may require further additions to imap_make_msg_set and breaking up
      imap_sync_mailbox, otherwise shouldn't be too bad. Not currently a
      major priority, though - noone's gotten bit by this.

* Have a hard time when the home namespace isn't default "".

* Mutt browses Cyrus IMAP servers poorly, because of Cyrus' feature where
  folders can contain messages *and* subfolders, and because of the 
  namespace problem, which Cyrus uses.

* The mutt_pretty routines don't work well when the delimiter isn't '/'.
